This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Router Dom v6 where a catch-all route (`/*`) interferes with other, more specific routes.  The problem arises when the catch-all route is declared before other routes, causing it to always match, even if a more specific route exists.  The solution involves simply reordering the routes to place the catch-all route last within the Routes component.
